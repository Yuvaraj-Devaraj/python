Starting with the capital letter I prevents any leading zeroes and still ensures a correct sorting sequence. The one trailing check digit completes the consignment number, utilising the LUHN checksum algorithm. The purpose of the check digit is to detect typing errors. The consignment number sequence will not be reset per consignor business unit, but be unique in its own. By that, it is possible to search on the consignment number only, without the need to utilise the consignor business unit code and type at the same time. However, the consignment identifier is only complete including that information, as stated above. The sequence of 10 usable digits will last for approximately 4500 years with a creation rate of 2.2 million consignments per year. A consignment number is never recycled. In legacy systems, the identifier may also start with another string instead of the capital letter ''I'' (e.g. ''ECIS''), and also have a number following a different pattern. For legacy consignments, the identifier is only guaranteed to be unique in its entirety together with the consignor reference, not to follow above pattern. QCID2945'

A business unit is an addressable and unique unit essential for IKEAï¿½s business. The BusinessUnitCode is unique per business unit type and contains a minimum of 3 and maximum of 5 characters in the range 0-9 and A-Z. BusinessUnitCodes that consist of numbers below 100 are filled with leading zeros in order to reach a total length of 3 digits (for example ''001'', ''099''). In order to avoid confusion, leading zeros are in general not used in BusinessUnitCCodes that have a length bigger than 3 digits. Note that this handling of leading zeros apply only to BusinessUnitCodes that solely consist of characters 0-9. There is one (temporary) exception to the minimum length of 3 characters, and that is for a virtual business unit called ''AP REG'' that was used for service agreement owners before 2017-02.

Starting with the capital letter I prevents any leading zeroes and still ensures a correct sorting sequence. The one trailing check digit completes the consignment number, utilising the LUHN checksum algorithm. The purpose of the check digit is to detect typing errors. The consignment number sequence will not be reset per consignor business unit, but be unique in its own. By that, it is possible to search on the consignment number only, without the need to utilise the consignor business unit code and type at the same time. However, the consignment identifier is only complete including that information, as stated above. The sequence of 10 usable digits will last for approximately 4500 years with a creation rate of 2.2 million consignments per year. A consignment number is never recycled. In legacy systems, the identifier may also start with another string instead of the capital letter ''I'' (e.g. ''ECIS''), and also have a number following a different pattern. For legacy consignments, the identifier is only guaranteed to be unique in its entirety together with the consignor reference, not to follow above pattern. QCID2945'

Starting with the capital letter I prevents any leading zeroes and still ensures a correct sorting sequence. The one trailing check digit completes the consignment number, utilising the LUHN checksum algorithm. The purpose of the check digit is to detect typing errors. The consignment number sequence will not be reset per consignor business unit, but be unique in its own. By that, it is possible to search on the consignment number only, without the need to utilise the consignor business unit code and type at the same time. However, the consignment identifier is only complete including that information, as stated above. The sequence of 10 usable digits will last for approximately 4500 years with a creation rate of 2.2 million consignments per year. A consignment number is never recycled. In legacy systems, the identifier may also start with another string instead of the capital letter ''I'' (e.g. ''ECIS''), and also have a number following a different pattern. For legacy consignments, the identifier is only guaranteed to be unique in its entirety together with the consignor reference, not to follow above pattern. QCID2945'

Starting with the capital letter I prevents any leading zeroes and still ensures a correct sorting sequence. The one trailing check digit completes the consignment number, utilising the LUHN checksum algorithm. The purpose of the check digit is to detect typing errors. The consignment number sequence will not be reset per consignor business unit, but be unique in its own. By that, it is possible to search on the consignment number only, without the need to utilise the consignor business unit code and type at the same time. However, the consignment identifier is only complete including that information, as stated above. The sequence of 10 usable digits will last for approximately 4500 years with a creation rate of 2.2 million consignments per year. A consignment number is never recycled. In legacy systems, the identifier may also start with another string instead of the capital letter ''I'' (e.g. ''ECIS''), and also have a number following a different pattern. For legacy consignments, the identifier is only guaranteed to be unique in its entirety together with the consignor reference, not to follow above pattern. QCID2945'

Starting with the capital letter I prevents any leading zeroes and still ensures a correct sorting sequence. The one trailing check digit completes the consignment number, utilising the LUHN checksum algorithm. The purpose of the check digit is to detect typing errors. The consignment number sequence will not be reset per consignor business unit, but be unique in its own. By that, it is possible to search on the consignment number only, without the need to utilise the consignor business unit code and type at the same time. However, the consignment identifier is only complete including that information, as stated above. The sequence of 10 usable digits will last for approximately 4500 years with a creation rate of 2.2 million consignments per year. A consignment number is never recycled. In legacy systems, the identifier may also start with another string instead of the capital letter ''I'' (e.g. ''ECIS''), and also have a number following a different pattern. For legacy consignments, the identifier is only guaranteed to be unique in its entirety together with the consignor reference, not to follow above pattern. QCID2945'

A business unit is an addressable and unique unit essential for IKEAï¿½s business. The BusinessUnitCode is unique per business unit type and contains a minimum of 3 and maximum of 5 characters in the range 0-9 and A-Z. BusinessUnitCodes that consist of numbers below 100 are filled with leading zeros in order to reach a total length of 3 digits (for example ''001'', ''099''). In order to avoid confusion, leading zeros are in general not used in BusinessUnitCCodes that have a length bigger than 3 digits. Note that this handling of leading zeros apply only to BusinessUnitCodes that solely consist of characters 0-9. There is one (temporary) exception to the minimum length of 3 characters, and that is for a virtual business unit called ''AP REG'' that was used for service agreement owners before 2017-02. Only historic data is expected to use this pattern.'
